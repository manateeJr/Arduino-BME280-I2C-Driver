# BME280-Driver-in-C
This driver is meant to read temperature and humidity, as well as set up the sampling rate of the sensor. You can choose from 5 rates for both humidity and temperature - 1X, 2X, 4X, 8X and 16X. The driver utilizes registers and the I2C communicatino protocol between an Arduino Uno and a BOSCH BME280 sensor. The Arduino is a master and requests information from the sensor whenever a value needs to be read. The code is written in a modular way, but a few improvements could be made - such as implementing a function to read a byte from the sensor. This is especially true when reading the DIG_X registers, as the same pattern is being repeated over and over again.
